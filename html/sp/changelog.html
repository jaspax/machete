                <h2>Version 1.3</h2>
                <ul class="machete-features">

                    <li>The new <b>Aggregate History</b> tab lets you view the
                        history for multiple campaigns simultaneously. Select
                        one or more campaigns from the select box and view all
                        of their history statistics together.

                    </li>
                    
                    <li>The <b>Aggregate Keyword</b> tab likewise combines
                        keyword reports from multiple sources into a single
                        place, letting you view and modify keywords from across
                        multiple campaigns.

                    </li>

                    <li>The Campaign History view now lets you view stats by
                    week and by month, rather than just by day.</li>

                    <li>...and other smaller bug fixes and improvements.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Version 1.2</h2>
                <ul class="machete-features">

                    <li><b>Product Display Ads are now fully supported!</b>.
                    Check out the "Campaign History" tab after clicking on
                    your campaign. Since Product Display Ads don't have
                    keywords, they don't have keyword analytics.</li>

                    <li>Select specific date ranges on the Campaign History tab
                        to see exacty what your metrics were on that date and
                        see how your campaign has changed in the selected time
                        range.

                    </li>

                    <li>Download the complete history of your campaign as a .csv
                        file for offline analysis.

                        (Notice how cool my hand-drawn red circle is.)
                    </li>

                    <li>The Keyword Analytics bubble chart has been revamped to
                        better represent the most important keyword metrics.

                    <li>... and a number of other smaller enhancements.</li>
