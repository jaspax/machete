                <h2>Version 1.1</h2>
                <ul class="machete-features">
                    <li>The new <b>Aggregate History</b> tab lets you view the
                        history for multiple campaigns simultaneously. Select
                        one or more campaigns from the select box and view all
                        of their history statistics together.

                    </li>
                    
                    <li>The <b>Aggregate Keyword</b> tab likewise combines
                        keyword reports from multiple sources into a single
                        place, letting you view and modify keywords from across
                        multiple campaigns.

                    </li>

                    <li>The Campaign History view now lets you view stats by
                    week and by month, rather than just by day.</li>

                    <li>...and other smaller bug fixes and improvements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Version 1.0</h2>

                <p>This is the first version. See <a href="https://machete-app.com/seller/welcome">the welcome page</a> for a list of features.</p>
