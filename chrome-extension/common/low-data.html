                <h2>Why don't I see any data?</h2>

                <p>Machete can only gather data from the moment it is installed.
                If you have just now installed, try coming back tomorrow---you
                should see hour-by-hour updated data starting from right
                now.</p>

                <p>Machete runs in your browser, so it also can't gather data when any of the following are true:
                <ul>
                    <li>Your computer is turned off</li>
                    <li>You are not signed in to Amazon Marketing Services.</li>
                    <li>You have closed your browser and have disabled the setting which allows Chrome to run apps in the background.</li>
                    <li>You do not have a working internet connection.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p>Finally, it's possible that your campaign just hasn't changed in
                the time frame you're looking at.</p>
