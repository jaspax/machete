            <h1>Why don't I see any data?</h1>

            <p>AMS Unlocked can only gather data from the moment it is
            installed. If you have just installed, then try coming back
            tomorrow---you should see hour-by-hour updated data starting from
            right now.</p>

            <p>AMS Unlocked also runs in your browser, so it can't gather data when any of the following are true:
            <ul>
                <li>Your computer is turned off</li>
                <li>You are not signed in to Amazon Marketing Services.</li>
                <li>You have closed your browser and have disabled the setting which allows Chrome to run apps in the background.</li>
                <li>You do not have a working internet connection.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p>Finally, it's possible that your campaign just hasn't changed in
            the time frame you're looking at.</p>
