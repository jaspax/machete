                <p class="ams-unlocked-welcome">Welcome to Machete! You're on your
                way to slashing through the jungles of Amazon Marketing Services and
                finding the city of gold.</p>

                <h2>How do I start?</h2>

                <p>Using Machete with AMS is a complicated 2-step process:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Log in to <a target="_blank" href="https://ams.amazon.com/ads/dashboard">Amazon Marketing Services</a>.</li>
                    <li>There is no second step.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>What does it do?</h2>

                <p>On the campaign dashboard, Machete adds a chart icon to every
                cell. Click on it to see a view of how that metric has changed over
                time. (Note that it may take a few days before these charts have
                much data.)</p>

                <p>On the campaign details page, Machete adds a new tab for Keyword
                Analytics, which gives you a visual representation of your keywords'
                impressions, clicks, and ACOS.</p>

                <img class="ams-unlocked-screenshot" src="/images/screenshots/keyword-analysis.png" />

                <p>You also get a number of reports showing your best and worst
                keywords, with the ability to modify those keywords individually or
                in bulk.</p>

                <p>Finally, Machete gives you a full-featured chart showing your
                campaign's performance history on a number of different metrics.</p>
