                <h2>Version 1.2</h2>
                <ul class="machete-features">

                    <li><b>Product Display Ads are now fully supported!</b>.
                    Check out the "Campaign History" tab after clicking on
                    your campaign. Since Product Display Ads don't have
                    keywords, they don't have keyword analytics.</li>

                    <li>Select specific date ranges on the Campaign History tab
                        to see exacty what your metrics were on that date and
                        see how your campaign has changed in the selected time
                        range.

                    <li>Download the complete history of your campaign as a .csv
                        file for offline analysis.

                    <li>The Keyword Analytics bubble chart has been revamped to
